Difference between Arrays and Collections:


Arrays:

1) Arrays are fixed in size.
2) With Respect to Memory Arrays are Not Recommended to Use.
3) With respect to Performance Arrays are Recommended to Use.
4) Arrays can Hold Only Homogeneous Data Elements.
5) Arrays can Hold both Primitives and Objects.
6) Arrays Concept is Not Implemented based on some Standard Data Structure. Hence Readymade Methods are Not Available.



Collections:
1)	Collections are Growable in Nature.
2)	With Respect to Memory Collections are recommended to Use.
3)	With respect to Performance Collections are Not Recommended to Use.
4)	Collections can Hold both Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Data Elements.
5)	Collections can Hold only Objects But Not Primitives.
6)	For Every Collection class underlying data structure is Available. Hence Readymade Methods are Available.
