Array:

An Array is an indexed collection of fixed number of homogeneous data elements.
The mail Advantages of Array is we can Represent Multiple values as a single variable so that 
Readability of the code will be improved.

Limitations of Object Type Arrays:

Arrays are  fixed in size.once we created an Array there is no chance of increasing and Decreasing 
size Based on Our Requirements.Hence to use Arrays concept compulsory we should know size in advance 
which may not be possible Always.

Arrays can Hold Only Homogeneous data Elements:

Eg:     Students[] s= new Students[10000];
        s[0]=new Student();
        
        
        s[1]=new Customer(); 
        
        Compile Time Error: Saying incompatible types
                            found:Customer
                            required:Student
                            
    We can Resolve this problem by using Object Type Arrays
    
        Object[] a=new Object[100000];
        a[0]=new Student(); 
        a[1]=new Customer();
        
        
        Arrays Concept is Not Implemented Based on some standard data Structure Hence Ready Made 
        Method Support is Not Available.Hence for Every Requirement we have to write the Code 
        Explicitly Which Increases the Complexity of the Program.
        
   Advantages Of Collection:
   
   Collections are Growable in Nature.That is based on our Requirement We can increase or decrease 
   the size.
   
   Collections can Hold both Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Data Elements.
   
   Every Collection Class is implemented based on some Standard Data Structure. Hence ready Made 
   Method Support is Available.Being a programmer we have to use those methods and we are Not 
   Responsible to Provide Implementation.
